## Inspiration
Around us we see many people even our loved ones struggling with mental health issues. These issues in our generation are increasing at an alarming rate. So we wanted to provide a safe environment for people to connect with a professional to help them with their struggles. A happy place for all kinds of people from all backgrounds at an affordable rate, flexible timings and also share their experiences with each other.  

## What it does
Calm Tree is a small independent nonprofit mental health website which provides trustworthy content to improve mental health and make healthy changes in you life style.

## How we built it
It is built on HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript. First, we made a prototype of this website and then used HTML to build the basic structure. Then for the styling part, we added CSS. For the better reach of the website, JavaScript and glider files are used.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to successfully transform our idea into a website, which can come to the aid of everyone.

## What we learned
Everybody in their lives needs some assistance once in a while and asking for help is not weakness, it's a sign of strength and growth.

## What's next for Calm Tree
Calm Tree can be further expanded into a full working website by contacting interested people, turning it into a platform from which everybody can get assistance and guidance to lead a happy and successful life.
